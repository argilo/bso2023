Radio Challenge Instructions
============================

Thanks to [Xanthus Security](https://www.xanthus.io/), each table has received an
[RTL-SDR](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr/nesdr-mini-2-plus.html)
â€” a powerful tool that can be used to receive hundreds of different signals,
once it's coupled with the right software. It's yours to use during the CTF,
and to keep afterwards.

Below are some software packages that you might find useful.
Many of them are available through the package manager in Ubuntu or Kali.
* [Gqrx SDR (Linux / MacOS)](https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx) - a software-defined radio receiver

* [SigDigger](https://batchdrake.github.io/SigDigger/) - a free digital signal analyzer
* [Inspectrum](https://github.com/miek/inspectrum) - a tool for analyzing captured signals
* [radioconda](https://github.com/ryanvolz/radioconda#radioconda) - cross-platform installers for a collection of open source radio packages
